## Storage Options Comparison

### Local Storage (Instance Storage)

**Best For**:
- Small to medium collections (<200GB)
- Performance-critical setups
- Budget-conscious users
- Single-server setups

**Pros**:
- Better performance (NVMe/SSD)
- No additional cost
- Lower latency
- Simpler setup

**Cons**:
- Fixed size
- Lost if instance is destroyed
- Requires instance upgrade to expand
- Backup more complex

**Cost Example**:
- Included with instance
- Vultr 320GB instance: $32/month total

### Block Storage

**Best For**:
- Growing collections
- Multi-server setups
- Future-proofing
- Flexible budgets

**Pros**:
- Expandable on demand
- Portable between instances
- Independent backups
- More flexible management

**Cons**:
- Additional cost
- Slightly lower performance
- More complex setup
- Network-dependent

**Cost Example**:
- Base: $1/10GB/month
- 500GB = $50/month additional

## Decision Factors

1. **Collection Size**:
   - <100GB: Local Storage
   - 100-200GB: Either Option
   - >200GB: Consider Block Storage

2. **Growth Rate**:
   - Static Collection: Local Storage
   - Growing Collection: Block Storage
   - Uncertain: Start Local, Plan for Block

3. **Budget Considerations**:
   ```
   Local Storage:
   - Instance cost only
   - Predictable monthly cost
   
   Block Storage:
   - Instance cost + storage cost
   - Scales with usage
   ```

4. **Performance Needs**:
   - Heavy transcoding: Local Storage
   - Direct Play mostly: Either Option
   - Multiple simultaneous streams: Local Storage

## Migration Strategy

### Start with Local → Move to Block
1. Begin with local storage
2. Monitor growth rate
3. Plan migration at 75% capacity
4. Add block storage before reaching limits

### Start with Block
1. Start small (250GB)
2. Expand as needed
3. Monitor costs vs usage
4. Optimize based on access patterns

## Recommendations by Use Case

1. **Personal Server** (1-2 users):
   - Start with Local Storage
   - 250-320GB instance
   - Monitor for 3 months

2. **Family Server** (3-5 users):
   - Consider Block Storage
   - Start with 500GB
   - Easy to expand

3. **Media Collector**:
   - Block Storage
   - Plan for growth
   - Regular optimization

4. **Performance Focus**:
   - Local Storage
   - Higher-tier instance
   - Regular cleanup

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Local Storage**:
   - Choose right initial size
   - Regular media optimization
   - Remove unused content

2. **Block Storage**:
   - Start small
   - Expand in 100GB increments
   - Monitor usage patterns
